## ␛ What I Do

I break things for a living [`security engineer`], automate everything obsessively [`DevOps addict`], and deploy everything to the cloud because servers are heavy and my back isn`t what it used to be.

## ⛩︎ The Hackers Codex (Philosophy)

## > Commit  
Lock in your target. Deploy full resources.  
When others waver and disconnect, we stay in the system.  
Commitment is our root access to possibilities others never see.  
Every breakthrough begins with an unbreakable resolve to execute.  

**_CARPE DIEM_** _[Seize the Day]_

## > Achieve  
Results are the only currency that matters.  
Achievement isn't about perfection; it's about relentless execution and adapting when the environment changes.  
Success leaves footprints in the logs.  

**_FACTIS UT CREDAM FACIS_** _[No need of words, trust deeds]_  
&nbsp;  

## > Repeat  
The loop that builds empires. Iteration is our superpower!  
Each cycle stronger, faster, more efficient than the last.  
We don't rest at version 1.0.  
The most dangerous competitors aren't the ones who succeed once, but those who make success an automated routine.
